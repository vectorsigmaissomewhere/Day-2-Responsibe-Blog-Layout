# Day-2-Responsibe-Blog-Layout

In my day 2 I am creating a responsibe Blog Layout

It's been 3 weeks working on it every 5 hours everyday

It is not reponsive enough

Moving towards Day 3 which is Project number 3 

If I got more time I will fix the css bug 

My css file from line number 400(I don't know the exact number of line). It is not working

End Project not the complete one
